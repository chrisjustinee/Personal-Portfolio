                            I am an ambitious and a versatile individual, who possesses various skill sets that I am enhancing and utilizing in order to create a successful career path. Specifically, I can perform a little bit of data analysis, through the use of my critical thinking ability as well as my familiarity with the RStudio, Tableau Prep Builder, and Tableau Desktop (Data Visualization Tools). Moreover, I possess basic knowledge and skills with regards to HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript, which I can use in creating front end and back end portions of various websites. In line with this, I also have good comprehension with database management as I am familiar with MySQL.
